      <h3>3D Printing</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy messing around my 3D printer at home when I have a chance. It is based off
        a cheap kit found on the internet that I bought back in the summer of 2016, but it
        has served me well and I have been able to use to print some subjectively cool things
        such as USB flash drive holders, phone stands, in-game character models and was also
        used for the hinge for a dish rack on one of my IPRO projects.

      <h3>Anime</h3>
      <p>Watching anime is still one of my favorite things to do when I'm around a computer.
      I don't really know what I would classify as my favorite, but below is a short list of
      some titles in no particular order that I enjoyed watching.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 Centimeters Per Second</li>
        <li>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</li>
        <li>Steins;Gate</li>
        <li>Shakugan no Shana</li>
        <li>Your Name</li>
