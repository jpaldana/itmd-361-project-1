      <h3>3D Printing</h3>
      <p>
        I enjoy messing around my 3D printer at home when I have a chance. It is based off
        a cheap kit found on the internet that I bought back in the summer of 2016, but it
        has served me well and I have been able to use to print some subjectively cool things
        such as USB flash drive holders, phone stands, in-game character models and was also
        used for the hinge for a dish rack on one of my IPRO projects.

      <h3>Anime</h3>
      <p>
        Watching anime is still one of my favorite things to do when I'm around a computer.
        I don't really know what I would classify as my favorite, but below is a short list of
        some titles in no particular order that I enjoyed watching.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>5 Centimeters Per Second</li>
        <li>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</li>
        <li>Steins;Gate</li>
        <li>Shakugan no Shana</li>
        <li>Your Name</li>

      <h3>Baking</h3>
      <p>
        I really enjoy baking whenever I can. It started off with those premade mixes and store
        bought ready-to-bake dough, but after a few runs I realized it would probably be better
        to start from scratch. Armed with the internet and the limitless amount of recipes you
        can find online, I started with a classic: the chocolate chip cookie.

        Not half bad, huh? It tasted pretty good too. I was pretty satisfied with the result. On
        the other hand, once you start baking and you realize it's pretty fun, there's no point
        stopping at plain old chocolate chip cookies (even though they were pretty awesome). I
        even tried to do that fancy little fruit garnish on the side with that chocolate swirl.

      All of the pictures above were taken with my Nikon D50 with the standard 28-80mm lens that
      came with the camera that I bought used off eBay a few years ago. I have no clue what I am
      doing half the time when I take pictures, but I can say for sure that it looks much better
      than what I can get with the camera on my phone.
